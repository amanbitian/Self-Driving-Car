2. 2D Object Detection (Using `Eulo Algorithm`)
3. Object Tracking (using the technique `Deep sort`)
4. 3D Data Visualization (Will visualize `Camera Images and Lidar Data`)
5. Multi Task Learning (based on 2 tasks `Depth estimation` & `Semantic Segmentation`) 
6. 3D Object Detection
7. Bird Eye View (Using Advance computer vision technique Called `Transformers`)
